# 42_push_swap
>The push_swap project focuses on sorting data within two stacks
>while minimizing the number of required moves.
>This task involves managing two stacks, 'a' and 'b,'
>initially with 'a' containing a set of positive and negative numbers without duplicates,
>while 'b' starts as an empty stack.
>The primary goal is to sort the numbers in stack 'a' in ascending order,
>with the smallest number positioned at the top.
>To accomplish this, the project offers a set of operations,
>including element swapping within stacks, element pushing between stacks,
>and element rotation within stacks.
>
>The key challenge involves finding the most efficient approach to sort numbers with as few operations as possible.
>This project tests the algorithmic and problem-solving skills
>since it requires creating efficient sorting strategies and applying them using the provided set of operations.

### Usage
1. clone this repository and `cd` into it:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/jmatheis00/42_push_swap.git && cd 42_push_swap
```

2. Compile the library using make:

```zsh
make
```

3. Run the project with the following command and replace `<number1 number2 (... numberN)>` bv the numbers you want to sort.

```zsh
./push_swap <number1 number2 (... numberN)>
```
